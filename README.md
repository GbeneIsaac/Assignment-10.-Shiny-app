# Assignment-10.-Shiny-app

R-Shiny app

Updates: Added 2 tap which is the facilities.

We also aded notes  to the right botton of the application 

Bassically we did updrade on the first application that we created ,
we changed the barground and added another statistics showing the number of fatalities with respect to each state. 
we did create a map as well which visualizes all the states. if you add a state,
it has to recalculate for some time and gives the map for that particular state inputed. 
This application is an upgraded version of of what we created in assignment 9.

In this application the lenght of it is not able to stretch as wide as we espected it
due to an unvisual blockage on the sides of the map.
